          Hi! I'm Alvin, a full-stack developer who started coding in 2023.
          Since then, I've built streaming platforms, blogs, and e-commerce
          sites. Whether it’s front-end finesse or back-end logic, I love
          bringing ideas to life on the web.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I’m not coding, you’ll find me playing Dota 2, cooking up new
          recipes, or streaming on Kick. Let's connect—I'd love to help with
          your next website or API project!
        </p>
