          Hi, I'm <strong>Kenny Sieu</strong> — a passionate{" "}
          <strong>Full-Stack Developer</strong> with a love for creating
          engaging and dynamic websites. Coding isn't just a job for me; it's
          something I truly enjoy. I thrive on bringing{" "}
          <strong>frontend concepts</strong> to life and constantly push myself
          to learn and explore new technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout my journey, I've worked on a variety of projects, each one
          helping me improve and grow as a developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me{" "}
          <strong>snowboarding</strong> or out at a{" "}
          <strong>music festival</strong> with my friends. I’m also a huge fan
          of exploring new places around the city and finding hidden gems.
          Whether it's a local café or an underground event, I love discovering
          what makes a place unique and vibrant.
