          Hi, I'm <strong>Kenny Sieu</strong> —{" "}
          <strong>a Full-Stack Developer. </strong> I have a genuine passion for
          building dynamic websites and apps. Coding isn't just a job for me -
          it's something I truly enjoy. I enjoy bringing{" "}
          <strong>frontend concepts and ideas</strong> to life and constantly
          push myself to learn and explore new technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve worked on a bunch of projects that have helped me grow and
          improve as a developer, and I’m always looking for new challenges to
          tackle.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me{" "}
          <strong>snowboarding</strong> or out at a{" "}
          <strong>music festival</strong> with my friends. I’m also a huge fan
          of exploring new places around the city and finding hidden gems.
        </p>
